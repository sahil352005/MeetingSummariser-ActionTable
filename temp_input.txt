Moderator (Ananya): Good morning, everyone. Let’s begin our weekly product development meeting. Today, we’ll focus on the new “SmartTrack” feature rollout and post-launch improvements.

Rohit (Product Manager): Morning, Ananya. I’ll start with updates from last week. The user feedback analysis is complete. Around 65% of users liked the SmartTrack feature, but a few mentioned slow response time when syncing location data.

Ananya: Noted. That’s a key issue we need to fix before the next release. Ravi, can your team look into optimizing the backend service for faster sync?

Ravi (Backend Lead): Yes, we’ve already profiled the API calls. We found that the delay mainly comes from the geolocation service. We’ll implement asynchronous processing and caching. I’ll share the updated version by Friday.

Ananya: Great. Once it’s ready, please coordinate with Meera’s QA team for testing.

Meera (QA Lead): Sure, we’ll begin regression and performance testing as soon as Ravi’s team delivers the build. I expect to complete testing by Tuesday next week.

Ananya: Excellent. Now, regarding the UI changes, Priya, how’s the redesign going?

Priya (Frontend Developer): I’ve updated the layout for the SmartTrack dashboard and improved the data visualization. I still need to fix responsiveness for mobile screens. I’ll finish that by Saturday.

Ananya: Perfect. Please share the Figma files with the marketing team for review.

Amit (Marketing Head): Yes, we’ll need those designs to prepare screenshots for the Play Store and website update. Once we receive the files, our team will finalize creatives by Wednesday next week.

Rohit: Also, we should plan an email campaign for existing users highlighting SmartTrack improvements.

Amit: Agreed. We’ll launch it along with the app update announcement.

Ananya: Good. Now, about data security compliance, Neel, have you completed the audit review?

Neel (Security Analyst): Yes, we’ve completed a preliminary audit. We just need to update our privacy documentation and add a consent checkbox for location tracking. I’ll send the updated report by Monday.

Ananya: That’s very important. Make sure it’s reviewed by the legal team before submission.

Ravi: Should I integrate the new consent workflow in the backend as well?

Ananya: Yes, please do. Coordinate with Neel for details.

Meera: Once that’s implemented, QA will validate the consent flow along with the performance fixes.

Ananya: Excellent. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize action items.

Ananya: Great. Our next sync-up meeting will be on 14th September at 10 AM. Please make sure to update your tasks in Jira before Friday evening. Thanks, everyone — meeting adjourned.

All: Thank you!
