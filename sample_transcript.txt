Moderator (Anna): Good morning, team. Let’s start today’s meeting about the new product launch and marketing campaign. We have a lot to cover, so let’s begin with the presentation progress.

John: Good morning, everyone. I’ve started working on the presentation slides. I’ve already added the product features and competitive analysis. I still need to include the pricing strategy and customer feedback section. I’ll complete the slides by Friday.

Anna: Excellent, John. Could you also add a short demo video to the slides?

John: Sure, I can prepare a short demo clip and insert it into the slides.

Sarah: On my side, I’ve spoken to two of our main vendors about the supply chain requirements. However, I still need to get confirmation from the third vendor. I’ll reach out to them by Monday.

Michael: That’s good progress, Sarah. Regarding finance, I’ve prepared a preliminary version of the budget. But I still need data on marketing expenses. Once I have that, I can finalize the report. I’ll aim to complete it by next Wednesday.

Anna: That’s great. We need the finalized budget as soon as possible so we can share it with management. Michael, can you also highlight the projected ROI?

Michael: Yes, I’ll include ROI projections in the final version.

David (Marketing Head): From the marketing side, we’re planning a social media campaign starting next month. We’ll need creative content, ads, and influencer collaborations. I’ll prepare a content calendar by next Friday.

Sarah: David, do you need vendor inputs for the marketing samples?

David: Yes, please. If you can get vendor confirmations by Monday, that will help us finalize the promotional material.

John: I also want to mention that the tech team has requested product screenshots for the website. I’ll provide them by Thursday.

Anna: Wonderful. Another important point is customer feedback. Have we collected enough data from the survey?

Michael: We received around 800 responses. I can prepare a short summary of key insights by Tuesday.

Anna: Perfect. That will be very useful. Also, let’s not forget about the product training session for the sales team.

Sarah: Right. We need to finalize the training date. I suggest 15th September.

David: That works. Marketing materials should be ready by then too.

Anna: Great. Before we close, let’s set our follow-up meeting on 10th September at 11 AM. By then, John will have slides ready, Sarah will have vendor confirmations, Michael will finalize the budget, and David will present the content calendar.

John: Agreed.

Sarah: Works for me.

Michael: Yes, that timeline is fine.

David: I’m on board too.

Anna: Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Let’s stick to the deadlines so we stay on track for the launch. Meeting adjourned.
