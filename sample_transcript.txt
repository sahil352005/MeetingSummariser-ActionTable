John: Good morning everyone. Let's start our weekly project meeting.

Sarah: Thanks John. I wanted to update everyone on the marketing campaign progress. We're on track for the Q4 launch.

Mike: That's great Sarah. I'll need to prepare the budget report by Friday to support the campaign.

John: Perfect Mike. Sarah, can you send me the campaign timeline by Wednesday?

Sarah: Absolutely. I'll also coordinate with the design team to finalize the graphics by Thursday.

Lisa: I'll review the legal requirements and get back to everyone by Tuesday with any compliance issues.

John: Excellent. Let's also schedule a follow-up meeting for next Monday to review everything before the launch.

Mike: Sounds good. I'll send out calendar invites after this meeting.

Sarah: One more thing - we should prepare a presentation for the stakeholders. Lisa, can you help with that?

Lisa: Sure, I'll work on the presentation and have a draft ready by Friday.

John: Great work everyone. Let's reconvene next Monday at 10 AM to finalize everything.
